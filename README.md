## 📁 Repository Structure

- **/Pulsera**  
  Contains the 3D models and drawings of the wristband enclosure that houses the piezoelectric sensor.

- **/Gabinete**  
  Contains the mechanical design of the acquisition unit enclosure, which holds the main electronics.

## 🧩 Design Details

- All parts are designed for **FDM 3D printing**
- Recommended material: **PLA**
- Designs tested with standard 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.2 mm layer height
- Fastening methods include M3 screws and epoxy sealing
- Tolerances were adjusted for typical consumer-grade printers

## 📂 Included Files

- `.STL` files (ready to print)
- `.STEP` files (for editing or integration)
- Reference images and dimensioned drawings

## 🧷 Assembly Notes

- The main enclosure is assembled using two half-shells joined by screws. Front and rear panels are implemented as PCBs for manufacturing simplicity and connector alignment.
